Hi,

This document is only made for newcomers in s42transfer who are digging into
the code.

Here is a little explaination of s42transfer's arboresence in a simplified
view only to show the most importants files and their role.

.
├── admin.php : adminitration interface, also permits to download files
├── f.php : permits to download files or show the download page
├── index.php : only provide a html/javascript client to interact with API
├── script.php : API interface and it's html documentation
├── install.php : installation script
├── tos.php : terms of use the user may edit
├── lib
│   ├── config.local.php : user's parameters
│   ├── config.original.php : default parameters with their documentation
│   ├── functions_*.js : javascript functions for html/javascript client
│   ├── functions.php : core functions and tools of s42transfer
│   ├── locales : langage folder, contain all langage files
│   └── template
│       ├─  footer.php
│       ├─  footer_admin.php
│       ├─  header_admin.php
│       └── header.php
├── media : folder containing all skins
├── uploads : folder containing all upload logo from admin panel
└── var-xxxxxxx : folder containing all data
    ├── async : chunks of uploaded files
    ├── files : all files that has been successfully uploaded
    └── links : all links pointing to files with meta-informations

Coding style:

- PHP function keywords are alone on a line
- Braces "{" must are put in a new line
- Files must be in UTF-8 (without BOM)
- Uses LF (\n) for end of lines

The whole project is not clean about that, feel free to fix :)
